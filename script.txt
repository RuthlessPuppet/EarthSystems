Pardon the anonuncement
We need to talk about YOUR safety
When was the last time you thought about the planet?
Probably not in a while
Big industries such as oil and electricity industries are poisioning the planet!
How are they poisoning the planet you may ask?
Well it's a mixture of human error and just plain laziness
No ones perfect, we all make mistakes, some more than others
And many big corporations simply do not care for the well being of the planet!
Now, you're probably wondering, "Why should I care about the planet? I have bigger worries!"
Well, dumping toxic waste is not just bad for the planet, but also very dangerous to us!
Runoff gets absorbed into the ground water that then gets used, which is very dangerous
That's why more eco-friendly options have been developed
Instead of burning coal for electricity, use solar, wind, or hydro methods
And instead of buying a gas-guzzling truck, get an electric vehicle
Help save the planet, and a life
